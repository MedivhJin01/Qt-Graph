# Qt-Graph
The project is an extended version of ECE250 Project3 which visualizes graph data structure using Qt libs.

# Introduction
The Project is developed based on undirected weighted graph structure and can be used to help UW CompEng 2A students on their ECE250 Project3. The project is written in C++ with Qt libraries. The project provides a simple UI and instruction mannual. It also provides save and open functions that allow users to save a graph or read a graph. In addition, basic graph functions have been included in the project such as insert vertex, adding edge, updating weight, etc. Advanced algorithms are also implemented in the project including Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, Minimum Spanning Tree Prim Method, Floyd-Warshall Algorithm.
